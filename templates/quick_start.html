        <h1>AI Art System - Quick Start Guide</h1>
        <h2>Definitions:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Vibe: The overall mood or emotional tone that the song clip conveys. What is the overall mood you feel
                from the song clip? </li>
            <li>Imagery: The visual elements or concepts inspired by the song, such as patterns, objects, or scenes.
            </li>
            <li>Style: The artistic approach or design aesthetic used in the visuals, like abstract, realistic, or
                retro.</li>
            <li>Color: The primary color palette that defines the visuals, influenced by the song's mood or energy.
                <strong>Note:</strong> this is subject to change and hard to control in AI models.
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Recommended: black and white -> sudden introduction of color at beat drop or crescendo</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Motion: The type of camera movement applied to the video, such as 2D (panning) or 3D (rotational)</li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Default: 2D</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <li>Strength: Defines the strength of the motion, how much you feel the visual change. Varies from weak,
                normal, strong to vstrong</li>
            <li><strong>Note: Except for Strength and Motion, all other inputs can have values other than those in the
                    dropdown menus. These are just suggestions.</strong></li>
            <li>Intervals: These are the main scene changes in your music video. You assign some vibe, color palette,
                texture, imagery and style and the AI video generator will use these to generate a continuous video that
                moves through the music.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Defaults are attached at relatively evenly spaced intervals and try to attach either to a nearby
                    beat or low-point in the song where it makes sense to change scenes.</li>
                <li><strong>Note:</strong> lines were drawn thick for visibility, but the left-most point on the green
                    intervals is where the scene change will take place</li>
                <li>Recommended: Keep texture and style consistent throughout scene changes, imagery and color are
                    subject to change.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Transitions: Dramatic visual or motion shifts added to sync with the music and make it more
                audio-reactive or introduce visual change.</li>
            <li>Initial Image: The starting visual reference that sets the tone or theme for the generated video.
                <strong>Note:</strong> AI generator will not adhere closely to the image, but will use the color palette
                and texture as suggestions.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Step 1: Upload Your Audio Clip</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Click on the <strong>“Upload Audio”</strong> button.</li>
            <li>Select an audio file from your device (supported formats: <code>.mp3</code>, <code>.wav</code>,
                <code>.m4a</code>).
            </li>
            <!-- <li>Click <strong>“Analyze Audio”</strong> to process your clip.</li> -->
        </ul>

        <h2>Step 2: Add Interval Segments</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You will be prompted to add or delete intervals. Move transitions to ideal locations when new imagery,
                or feeling is to be expressed and align <strong>left side</strong> of interval to point of visual
                change.</li>
            <li>Techniques: </li>
            <ul>
                <li>1) Align intervals to beats or low points in the song and change imagery or color (especially good
                    if the vibe of the song suddenly changes)</li>
                <li>2) Align intervals at even locations for less dynamic songs and use transitions to incorporate
                    visual change</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h2>Step 3: Add Transition Segments</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You will be prompted to manually add transition motions or fill with defaults. Default transitions give
                1 second around each interval to indicate a scene change occuring and 1.5 seconds at the end for big and
                impactful ending motion (<strong>Recommended:</strong> vstrong rotation/spin or zoom)</li>
            <li>Tips:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If transition time is short, ensure strong or vstrong strength to ensure they can be felt, or give
                    longer time for the transitions.</li>
                <li>Recommendations:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Upward pan or rotate on crescendos or upon increase in song's energy</li>
                    <li>Use zoom_in while having a translation_x with sinusoidal strength for swerving effect. <a

                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>Press <strong>Finalize Timestamps</strong> button when done</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Step 4: Feel The Music</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Feel the Music and determine an accurate overall vibe, imagery, texture and color scheme. This will
                auto-populate the final table which breaks down each interval and transition's input parameters.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Step 5: Choose an Initial Image</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To the right of the "Input Details" box is an image gallery with some popular image and texture
                combinations to use as initial images. Click on one to populate the texture and imagery input boxes.
            </li>
            <li>If you prefer to create your own, use the Brainstorming section to generate images from textual prompt
                or upload an image directly. Focus on color palettes, textures, and vibes when selecting an initial
                image.</li>
            <li>Press <strong>Fill With Defaults</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Step 6: Finalize Prompt Parameter Table</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Modify inputs in the table as needed to match the overall scene you want to be represented for each
                chunk of the song.</li>
            <li>Preset Defaults (subject to change for artistic vision):</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Motion for scene intervals is zoom in by default</li>
                <li>Motion for transitions is strong rotate right (3D) or pan right (2D) by default</li>
                <li>Final transition is a very strong rotation (3D) or spin (2D) </li>
                <li>Motion and Strength can have multiple different motions at the same time. And you can put in your own numbers or sin/cos/tan based equations.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Motion: zoom_in,pan_right</li>
                    <li>Stength: vstrong,10*sin(2*3.14*t/10)</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>Press <strong>Create Video</strong>. Final output will have the inputs passed into the AI model along
                with a link to the generated video and a link with the video automatically stitched with the input
                audio.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- <ul>
            <li>Each segment should be around <strong>5 seconds</strong>, with <strong>1 second for
                    transitions</strong>.</li>
            <li>If a segment is shorter than <strong>3 seconds</strong>, consider removing transitions to avoid
                overshadowing.</li>
            <li>Suggested Ending Effects: <strong>Zoom in, Zoom out</strong>.</li>
            <li>Suggested Transitions:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pan Up</strong>, <strong>Pan Down</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Pan Left</strong>, <strong>Pan Right</strong></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><em>Quick Setup Tip:</em> Copy and paste the same settings across all segments for a fast trial run.

            <li>Preview the output and make adjustments if needed.</li>
        </ul> -->

        <!-- <h2>Step 4: Export or Share</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Download your creation by clicking <strong>“Export”</strong>.</li>
            <li>Share it on social platforms or with collaborators.</li>

            <strong>Additional Tips:</strong><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Experiment with different transition effects and segment lengths to enhance creativity.</li>
                <li>Zoom in and zoom out do not express strength other than the default in 3D motion. It works fine in 2D motion, so switch to that if you want more expressive motions.</li>
